# Full Stack Engineer Code Challenge

Thanks for interviewing at Postlight as a Full Stack Engineer. We’re asking you to complete this take-home code challenge so that we can better understand your technical skills. Expect to spend up to 8 hours working on this challenge, as your schedule allows. Let us know if you cannot complete the challenge within a week. Be creative, and have fun! If you have any questions about this challenge, feel free to reach out. Reply to the original email in which you received this challenge and we will get back to you as soon as we can (within a couple of business days).

### The Task

- Showcase your skills by creating an employee directory web application that’s comprised of a front and back end built using modern tools. Include names, pictures, job titles, and anything else you see fit. Go as deep with the front end and back end as you desire. For example, if you’re primarily a front end developer, you could use an API mocking tool. If you’re primarily a back end developer, you could focus on implementing search or modern API standards like GraphQL or JSON API.
- At Postlight, we value code quality and readability along with functional code. The code submitted should be production quality and something you would use in a real application.
- We don’t expect you to complete every suggested feature below.

### Suggested Features

- Setup instructions and notes on how you built the application.
- Use of a front end framework, ideally React.
- Modern API, we commonly use Node in-house.
- Ability to display employees by department, title, location, etc.
- Use of a client-side router.
- Creative use of animation.
- Paginated lists.
- Forms for creating, updating, and deleting employees.
- Source data from a third party person API, such as https://randomuser.me or http://uifaces.com.
- Ability to search for employees.
- Testing.

### What We’re Not Looking For

We don’t expect your visual design to be perfectly polished. We’re more interested in your implementation than your design. It’s okay and encouraged to use existing libraries and frameworks. We know you will be missing assets you would include in a production environment (like icons and logos). Skip those and document what would be more complete in your project in a production environment.

### Delivery

Once complete, please reply to the original email with your submission. We encourage you to include a git repository with history, excluding any files you would typically leave uncommitted (such as your node_modules folder). If you need more time, we understand -- just let us know.
